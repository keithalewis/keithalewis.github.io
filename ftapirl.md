# FTAP IRL

Bruno asked for the title of the talk.

Me: 'FTAP IRL'

Bruno: 'ROFL'

But IRL doesn't stand for In Real Life.

The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing Is Really Lame.

It took 5 months to explain this to Peter Carr, so there is no way to
explain it in 5min. All I can do is whet your appetite, give you
references and let you know where I live.

I don't have a Nobel prize, but I know when a theory is wrong.

## Second Touch Barrier Options.

IRL, a trader asked me how to price a barrier option that
knocked in the _second_ time the barrier was hit.

I knew the answer. I studied Brownian Motion in grad school
and the Black-Scholes/Merton theory at my dining room table
after long days of getting beaten up on the trading floor.

It has exactly the same price!

As a matter of fact...

A barrier option that knocks in the millionth time the barrier
is hit has exactly the same price!!!

You see, Brownian Motion has this very interesting infinite
oscillatory behavior.
On any finite interval it is almost surely not of bounded variation...

The trader looked at me as if I had lost my mind.

That is the answer the theory gives. And it is obviously wrong.

He didn't talk to me again for 3 months.

In physics, when theory is contradicted by observation it is time to
come up with a new theory.

In mathematical finance, the solution seems to be to come up with
a more obfuscated theory that practitioners cannot possibly understand.

shouldn't be doing it." --Deane Yang

I wanted a theory people who use it to run a business
can comprehend and can be implmented on a computer
to give results they find useful.

So I came up with one.

It is a rigorous mathematical theory that can be applied to
valuing, hedging, and assessing the risk of any instrument.

It is simpler to implement on a computer than the classical theory.

It can be taught in Mathematical Finance programs.

It provides knobs required for IRL application.
