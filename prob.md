# Probability

The study of _probability_ used to be a disreputable pursuit.  It had its
origin in gambling where theoretical advances were immediately applied
to lighten the wallets of anyone foolish enough to take up a challenge.

The first approaches involved counting: how many ways can something happen?

Laplace's rule

Kolmogorov legitimized it using measure theory.

The first step is to specify a _sample space_ of all outcomes.

A subset of the sample space is called an _event_.

The second step is to assign _probabilities_ to each outcome.

A _random variable_ is a function on the sample space. It can
take values in any set, but usually in the real numbers or
a vector of real numbers.

It can be used just like a variable in an equation, but allows
additional information to be incorporated: the probability it
has certain values.

## Examples

...

### Coin Flip

The sample space is $\{H,T\}$ denoting the possible outcomes
of either a head or a tail as the result of a flip. If the coin is
fair there is equal probability of either result so
$P({H}) = 1/2 = P({T})$.

### Die Roll

The sample space is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ denoting the face of the die
rolled. For a fair die $P({i}) = 1/6$ for $i$ in the sample space.

The event _roll an even number_ corresponds to the subset
$\{2,4,6\}$.
