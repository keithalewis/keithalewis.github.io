# American Options.

Consider a 2 period binomial model.

Let $\Omega = {-1,1}^2$, $P$ be uniform measure, and $W_j(\omega) =
\sum_{i\le j}\omega_i$.

Assume there is a bond with price $R_j = 1$, and stock with price $S_j
= W_j$.  We want to find an arbitrage free model that also contains an
American option that pays $\phi(S_j)$ if exercised at $j$ where
$j = 1$ or $j = 2$.

A_0 = {\Omega}

A_1 =
