Keith A. Lewis started his professional career as a J. D. Tamarkin
assistant professor at Brown where he pioneered the use of computers as a
classroom tool in mathematics. He went on to work on Wall Street
at Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley, and Banc of America Securities. (That
is not a typo. It was during the dregs end of the Glass-Steagall Act
that forbid banks to traffic in stocks.)

He and his team built equity derivative libraries and made the
numbers used to run the business available to the trading desk via
high-performance Excel add-ins. Supporting spreadsheets traders use
was an excellent way to elicit user needs and rapidly prototype
products that resulted in production quality code.

Since 2002 Keith has been a consultant for hedge funds of various shapes
and sizes building valuation models and tools for exploring, testing,
and implementing trading strategies. His specialty is rolling up his
sleeves to solve difficult, messy problems.  Other projects include
insurance companies involved with GPU computing, law firms certifying
tax conformance of trades, and municipal bond refunding.

He has spun off a number of open source projects based on his experience
with building tools his clients found useful and has been using them
in courses he has taught at NYU, Rutgers, Cornell, and Columbia.

Last year he was on the road one week a month attending union negotiations
involving a major airline merger. The startup he was involved with turned
big data into meaningful numbers that were used by union negotiators to
get better results for their members.

Keith is currently involved with a challenging project at Bloomberg that
involves huge data because he is quite certain gigantic data is inevitable.
